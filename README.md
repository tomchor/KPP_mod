This contribution contains only one file: empirical.csv
This is a comma-separated file with three columns:

1. σ: Normalized vertical coordinate (σ=1 is the bottom of the surface layer)
2. G_l: Eddy diffusivity shape function obtained from wavy simulations
3. g_s (lower case): Base function for the surface-driven nondiffusive transport shape G_s (uppercase)
